Codes and data for Planton et al. (2024)

In the paper we developed a methodology to estimate the required ensemble size for a particular application, before the ensemble is generated (section 3.4).
To do so, we base our estimates from non-overlapping epochs of the piControl experiments.
Here is an example of results for Ni√±o3 SSTA variance sing 30-year epochs.
