## Project
To model the climate, scientists often generate an ensemble of simulations with a given climate model and given forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gas emissions) but different plausible initial conditions. These different initial conditions represent the uncertainties on the Earth’s climate conditions at the start of the simulation. As Earth’s climate naturally fluctuates on multiple timescales (‘internal variability’), each simulation of the ensemble (‘member’) represents a possible evolution of the climate. By averaging the climate over a large enough ensemble, one can separate the internal variability from forced changes (e.g., changes forced by greenhouse gas emissions). The number of members required for an ensemble to be ‘large enough’ depends on the model and the objective of the analysis.
In the paper we analyzed internal variability simulated by climate models and developed a methodology to estimate the ensemble size for a particular application, before the ensemble is generated (section 3.4). To do so, we base our estimates on non-overlapping epochs of the piControl experiments.
